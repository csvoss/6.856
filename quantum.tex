\section{Yao's Principle in Quantum Information}

Yao's principle isn't just used for proving lower bounds on the competitiveness of algorithms. Another application is found in the study of certain games in quantum information, where Yao's principle can show worst-case bounds of game strategies. In this section, we will examine this use, as demonstrated in \emph{Worst Case Analysis of Non-local Games} by Ambainis et al.~\cite{ABBSSV}.

\subsection{Quantum Preliminaries}

Consider a game between two players and an adversary, where the two players receive random input from the adversary and must each return outputs jointly satisfying a condition without communicating with each other during the game. Analysis under classical physics conditions and quantum physics conditions has demonstrated quantum information allows for better strategies.

An example of such a game is the Clauser--Horne--Shimonyi--Holt (CHSH) game~\cite{CHSH}:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The two players may collude to set up a strategy beforehand but may not communicate afterwards.}
\item{The adversary chooses a random $\vec{x}=(x_1, x_2)$ from~$X=\{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\}$. The random choice is uniform, with $\frac14$ probability each.}
\item{The players 1~and~2 receive the values $x_1$~and~$x_2$, respectively.}
\item{In the quantum setting, the players 1~and~2 may also possess an entangled 2-part quantum state~$\ket{\psi}$, which they may measure.}
\item{Using their strategy, the players 1~and~2 output the values $a_1(x_1)$~and~$a_2(x_2)$, respectively.}
\item{The players win if $a_1 \oplus a_2 = x_1 \wedge x_2$.}
\end{itemize}

Both under classical physics and under any ``local hidden variable theory'' -- an explanation of quantum phenomena as being due to extra local hidden variables -- the best that the players can achieve is a win probability of~$0.75$. If the players are allowed to share entangled quantum bits, however, then they can win more often, with a win probability of~$\frac12 + \frac1{2\sqrt2} = 0.8535\ldots$~\cite{ABBSSV,CHSH}.

The CHSH game was designed as a testable experiment, and experiments have since confirmed that the universe is consistent with quantum entanglement, and not consistent with local hidden variable theories~\cite{aspect}.

In \emph{Worst Case Analysis of Non-local Games} by Ambainis et al., the authors examine generalized games beyond the simple CHSH game, and analyze the worst-case performance of strategies in both classical and quantum environments~\cite{ABBSSV}.

\subsection{Generalized CHSH}

The CHSH game is played between two players and an adversary. We generalize the game from two players to $n$ players. Ambainis et al.~call this the \emph{$n$-party AND game}~\cite{ABBSSV}.

The authors note that this game has not been studied before because of the simplicity of its strategies in the classical setting: by outputting $a_i=0$, the players are guaranteed to win unless the adversary happened to pick $x_i=1$. Therefore, against an adversary that always chooses $\vec{x}$ uniformly, the players can win with probability $1-2^n$.

However, this game becomes more interesting when we consider worst-case bounds: if the adversary is allowed to choose $\pi$, the optimal strategy for the players becomes less trivial. The authors show that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\Pr[win] = 2/3$ in both the classical case and the quantum case~\cite{ABBSSV}.

The $n$-party AND game and the CHSH game share the same win condition, $\bigoplus \vec{a} = \bigwedge \vec{x}$. To generalize this further, we can imagine games with arbitrary win conditions. Let the \textbf{Generalized CHSH Game} be as follows.

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item{The $n$ players may collude to set up a strategy beforehand, but may not communicate afterwards.}
%% \item{The adversary chooses a random $\vec{x}=(x_1, ..., x_n) \in X_1 \times ... \times X_n$, for some $X_1, ..., X_n$. The random choice is governed by a probability distribution $\pi$; each $\vec{x}$ is chosen with probability $\pi(\vec{x})$.}
%% \item{The players $1, ..., n$ receive the values $x_1, ..., x_n$, respectively.}
%% \item{In the quantum setting, the players may also possess an entangled $n$-part quantum state $\ket{\psi}$, which they may measure.}
%% \item{Using their strategy, the players $1, ..., n$ output the values $\vec{a} = a_1(x_1), ..., a_n(x_n)$, respectively.}
%% \item{The players win if $\bigoplus \vec{a} = \bigwedge \vec{x}$. Let the indicator variable $\texttt{win}(\vec{a}|\vec{x}) = 1$ if they win, $-1$ otherwise.}

% \subsection{Fully Generalized Games}



\begin{itemize}
\item{The $n$ players may collude and strategize beforehand but may not communicate afterwards.}
\item{The adversary chooses a random $\vec{x}=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ from~$X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n$, for some $X_1, \ldots, X_n$. The random choice is governed by a probability distribution~$\pi$; each $\vec{x}$ is chosen with probability~$\pi(\vec{x})$.}
\item{The players~$1, \ldots, n$ receive the values~$x_1, \ldots, x_n$, respectively.}
\item{In the quantum setting, the players may also possess an entangled $n$-part quantum state~$\ket{\psi}$, which they may measure.}
\item{Using their strategy, the players~$1, \ldots, n$ output the values~$\vec{a} = a_1, \ldots, a_n$, respectively.}
\item{The players win if some proposition~$\texttt{win}(\vec{a} \Mid \vec{x})$ is true. Let the indicator variable~$\texttt{win}(\vec{a} \Mid \vec{x}) = 1$ if they win and $-1$ otherwise.}
\end{itemize}

For any game~$G$, define $\omega^\pi(G)$ as $\Pr[\textrm{Win}] - \Pr[\textrm{Lose}]$ when $\pi$ is a probability distribution according to which the adversary chooses $\vec{x}$. Let $\omega(G)$ be the worst case $\omega^\pi(G)$: the minimum value of $\omega^\pi(G)$ over distributions $\pi$ that the adversary can choose from. Let $\omega_q$ and $\omega_c$ be $\omega$ in the quantum and classical cases, respectively. We defined the indicator variable $\texttt{win}(\vec{a}\Mid\vec{x})$ such that $\Pr[\textrm{Win}] - \Pr[\textrm{Lose}] = \Expected[ \texttt{win}(\vec{a}\Mid\vec{x}) ]$. Therefore, we can more formally define $\omega(G)$ and $\omega^\pi(G)$ as follows:

\begin{align*}
	\omega^\pi(G) &\equiv \max_{\vec{a}} \Expected_{\vec{x} \in \pi} \texttt{win}(\vec{a}\Mid\vec{x}) \\
	\omega(G) &\equiv \max_{\vec{a}} \min_\pi \Expected_{\vec{x} \in \pi} \texttt{win}(\vec{a}\Mid\vec{x}).
\end{align*}

Recent research in quantum information has considered finding games which exemplify a difference between the quantum and classical settings: seeking to maximize the ratio~$\omega_q^\pi(G) / \omega_c^\pi(G)$~\cite{ABBSSV}. Interestingly, for every possible proposition $\texttt{win}$, the separation ratio~$\omega_q(G) / \omega_c(G)$ when the adversary chooses the worst distribution~$\pi$ \emph{separately} for the classical and quantum case is at most the maximum value of $\omega_q^\pi(G) / \omega_c^\pi(G)$ over a fixed distribution~$\pi$. This proof uses Yao's minimax principle.

\begin{theorem}
	$$\frac{\omega_q(G)}{\omega_c(G)} \leq \max_\pi \frac{\omega_q^\pi(G)}{\omega_c^\pi(G)}.$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

As with the earlier applications of Yao's minimax principle, the adversary chooses a strategy over a distribution of inputs~$\vec{x}$ to pass to the players, and the players may still use randomized algorithms as strategies. However, instead of letting the cost be \emph{running time}, the cost is the \emph{probability of winning}. The adversary attempts to minimize cost and the two players' joint algorithms attempt to maximize cost.

Recall Yao's minimax principle, but instead of stating that any (including the best) randomized algorithm when run on its own worst-case input can perform no better than the best deterministic algorithm when run on any (including the worst) specific distribution of inputs, we will now state that the players' best randomized algorithms when run on their worst-case input can perform no better than the players' best deterministic algorithms when run on the worst distribution~$\pi$ of inputs from the adversary.

The players' best deterministic algorithm against the worst distribution~$\pi$ over random inputs from the adversary is $\max_{\vec{a}} \min_{\pi} \Expected_{\vec{x} \in pi} \texttt{win}(\vec{a}\Mid\vec{x})$, which is defined to be $\omega_c(G)$. The players' best randomized algorithm against the worst input is $\min_\pi \max_{\vec{a}} \Expected_{\vec{x} \in pi} \texttt{win}(\vec{a}\Mid\vec{x})$, which is $\min_\pi \omega^\pi_c(G)$.

This gives us a bound on the worst-case win probability under classical conditions: $\omega_c(G) \geq \min_{\pi} \omega_c^\pi(G)$. Suppose $\pi$ is the probability distribution that achieves this minimum; then $\omega_q^\pi(G) \geq \omega_q(G)$, because fixing $\pi$ can only allow the players to achieve a better win probability than their worst-case $\omega_q(G)$.
\end{proof}
