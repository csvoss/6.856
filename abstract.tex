	We introduce Yao's minimax principle \cite{yao} and present a series of online and non-local games for which we illustrate the use of Yao's principle in bounding the effectiveness of an optimal solution. In particular, we look at the removable online knapsack problem \cite{han}, the online coloring co-interval graph problem \cite{zarrabi}, and a multiplayer extension of the CHSH quantum game \cite{ABBSSV} to demonstrate how combining an algorithm with an input distribution can tighten the interval on which we know the optimal solution lies.
